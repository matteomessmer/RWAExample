RealWear Academy Example project written in Java

In this repo there is the project of the Day 2 of the RealWear Developer Academy

# The project in this repo
This is the first Android Studio project I made for the HMT-1 device.

This app has a button that when pressed open the Camera App to take a photo. After a photo has been taken it opens the document Viewer 

The button has the contentDescription attribute "hf_persists|hf_no_number|hf_show_text|hf_overlay_offset:0,50|Scatta foto" which is used to display a label and also implement the vocal command "Scatta foto" to open the camera.

The app has been tested on Android 10, it doesn't work on Android 11.
